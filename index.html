    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML, standing for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It structures the content on the web page and uses tags to describe different types of content such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists and more.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What is an HTML tag?</strong><br>An HTML tag is a markup construct that begins with < and ends with >. Tags are used to mark up the start and end of an HTML element.</li>
        <li><strong>Why do tags need to be "opened" and "closed"?</strong><br>HTML tags are usually paired and surround content. The opening tag signifies the start of a piece of content; the closing tag signifies the end. The tags help the browser interpret the type of content (text, image, etc.) and how to display it.</li>
        <li><strong>What is an HTML attribute?</strong><br>An HTML attribute is a modifier that provides additional information about the element. Attributes are included in the opening tag and consist of a name and a value, separated by an equals (=) sign. Examples include id, class, style, and src.</li>
        <li><strong>What is an HTML element?</strong><br>An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML document or web page. It's usually made up of a start tag, some content, and an end tag.</li>
    </ul>
